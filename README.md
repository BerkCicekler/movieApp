# Movie App
A simple app for discovering, searching, and saving movies to your watchlist.

## Description
Movie App is my first project built with SwiftUI. The app allows users to explore new movies, search for specific titles, and create a personalized watchlist.
As a beginner in SwiftUI, this project may not fully adhere to clean code principles, but I have put in my best effort to make it functional and easy to use.

## Features  
- Discover trending and popular movies.
- Search for movies by title.
- Save movies to your watchlist for future viewing.

## API
The App uses [TMDB API](https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs/getting-started)
